snowdrop.emmood,"It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working at her window.",N:N,N:N
snowdrop.emmood,"The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it.",Sa:N,S:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, ""Would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as black as this ebony windowframe!""",Sa:N,S:N
snowdrop.emmood,"And so the little girl really did grow up; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.",N:N,N:H
snowdrop.emmood,"But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was.",H:N,S:F
snowdrop.emmood,"She had a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon herself in it, and say:",N:N,N:F
snowdrop.emmood,"""Tell me, glass, tell me true!",N:N,N:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Of all the ladies in the land, Who is fairest, tell me, who?""",N:N,N:N
snowdrop.emmood,And the glass had always answered:,N:N,N:N
snowdrop.emmood,"""Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.""",H:N,N:N
snowdrop.emmood,"But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.",H:N,N:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it as usual:",N:N,N:N
snowdrop.emmood,"""Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see, But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!""",A:N,A:N
snowdrop.emmood,"When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, ""Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I may never see her any more.""",A:A,A:A
snowdrop.emmood,"Then the servant led her away; but his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he said, ""I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.""",Sa:N,S:H
snowdrop.emmood,"So he left her by herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.",F:N,S:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm.",F:F,S:F
snowdrop.emmood,"In the evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for her little feet would carry her no further.",F:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Everything was spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by the wall stood seven little beds.",N:N,N:N
snowdrop.emmood,"As she was very hungry, she picked a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest.",N:N,N:N
snowdrop.emmood,"So she tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself down and went to sleep.",H:N,H:N
snowdrop.emmood,By and by in came the masters of the cottage.,F:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Now they were seven little dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.",N:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not right.",F:N,F:-
snowdrop.emmood,"The first said, ""Who has been sitting on my stool?""",A:A,A:A
snowdrop.emmood,"The second, ""Who has been eating off my plate?""",A:A,A:A
snowdrop.emmood,"The third, ""Who has been picking my bread?""",A:A,A:A
snowdrop.emmood,"The fourth, ""Who has been meddling with my spoon?""",A:A,A:A
snowdrop.emmood,"The fifth, ""Who has been handling my fork?""",A:A,A:A
snowdrop.emmood,"The sixth, ""Who has been cutting with my knife?""",A:A,A:A
snowdrop.emmood,"The seventh, ""Who has been drinking my wine?""",A:A,A:A
snowdrop.emmood,"Then the first looked round and said, ""Who has been lying on my bed?""",A:A,A:A
snowdrop.emmood,"And the rest came running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed.",A:A,A:A
snowdrop.emmood,"But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought their lamps to look at her, and said, ""Good heavens! what a lovely child she is!""",Su+:Su+,H:+
snowdrop.emmood,"And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone.",H:H,H:H
snowdrop.emmood,"In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care of her.",Sa:Sa,H:H
snowdrop.emmood,"Then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at home; and they warned her, and said, ""The queen will soon find out where you are, so take care and let no one in.""",F:N,H:N
snowdrop.emmood,"But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and said:",F:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"""Tell me, glass, tell me true!",N:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Of all the ladies in the land, Who is fairest, tell me, who?""",N:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,And the glass answered:,N:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"""Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land: But over the hills, in the greenwood shade, Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made, There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.""",A:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.",F:F,F:F
snowdrop.emmood,"And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt.",A:N,F:A
snowdrop.emmood,"Then she knocked at the door, and cried, ""Fine wares to sell!""",N:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Snowdrop looked out at the window, and said, ""Good day, good woman! what have you to sell?""",N:N,F:H
snowdrop.emmood,"""Good wares, fine wares,"" said she; ""laces and bobbins of all colours.""",N:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"""I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good sort of body,"" thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.",H:N,F:H
snowdrop.emmood,"""Bless me!"" said the old woman, ""how badly your stays are laced!",N:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces.""",N:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Snowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop""s breath was stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead.",Su-:N,F:-
snowdrop.emmood,"""There""s an end to all thy beauty,"" said the spiteful queen, and went away home.",A:A,F:A
snowdrop.emmood,"In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as if she was quite dead.",Sa:Sa,F:S
snowdrop.emmood,"However, they lifted her up, and when they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe, and very soon came to life again.",H:N,F:H
snowdrop.emmood,"Then they said, ""The old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away.""",A:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it as before; but to her great grief it still said:",A:Sa,F:-
snowdrop.emmood,"""Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land: But over the hills, in the greenwood shade, Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made, There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.""",A:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb.",A:A,A:A
snowdrop.emmood,"When she reached the dwarfs"" cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, ""Fine wares to sell!""",A:N,A:N
snowdrop.emmood,"But Snowdrop said, ""I dare not let anyone in.""",F:F,A:F
snowdrop.emmood,"Then the queen said, ""Only look at my beautiful combs!"" and gave her the poisoned one.",N:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head, the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless.",Su-:N,F:-
snowdrop.emmood,"""There you may lie,"" said the queen, and went her way.",H:N,F:-
snowdrop.emmood,"But by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb.",F:N,F:-
snowdrop.emmood,"And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone.",F:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before; and she said, ""Snowdrop shall die, if it cost me my life.""",A:A,F:A
snowdrop.emmood,"So she went by herself into her chamber, and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die.",A:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Then she dressed herself up as a peasant""s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs"" cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, ""I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.""",F:F,F:F
snowdrop.emmood,"""Do as you please,"" said the old woman, ""but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will give it you.""",F:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"""No,"" said Snowdrop, ""I dare not take it.""",F:F,F:F
snowdrop.emmood,"""You silly girl!"" answered the other, ""what are you afraid of?",A:A,F:A
snowdrop.emmood,Do you think it is poisoned?,A:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.""",A:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned.",F:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer.",F:N,F:N
snowdrop.emmood,"But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground.",Sa:N,S:F
snowdrop.emmood,"""This time nothing will save thee,"" said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it said:",H:N,S:F
snowdrop.emmood,"""Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.""",H:N,S:N
snowdrop.emmood,"And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be.",H:H,S:F
snowdrop.emmood,"When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid that she was quite dead.",F:F,S:F
snowdrop.emmood,"They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead.",Sa:N,S:S
snowdrop.emmood,"So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, ""We will never bury her in the cold ground.""",Sa:Sa,S:S
snowdrop.emmood,"And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was, and that she was a king""s daughter.",Sa:N,S:S
snowdrop.emmood,"And the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched.",Sa:N,S:S
snowdrop.emmood,"And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.",Sa:Sa,S:S
snowdrop.emmood,"And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony.",N:N,S:S
snowdrop.emmood,"At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs"" house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden letters.",Su+:N,S:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said, ""We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.""",Sa:Sa,S:S
snowdrop.emmood,"At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop awoke, and said, ""Where am I?""",Su+:Sa,H:S
snowdrop.emmood,"And the prince said, ""Thou art quite safe with me.""",H:N,H:H
snowdrop.emmood,"Then he told her all that had happened, and said, ""I love you far better than all the world; so come with me to my father""s palace, and you shall be my wife.""",H:N,H:H
snowdrop.emmood,"And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding.",H:N,H:H
snowdrop.emmood,"To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop""s old enemy the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the glass and said:",N:N,H:N
snowdrop.emmood,"""Tell me, glass, tell me true!",N:N,H:N
snowdrop.emmood,"Of all the ladies in the land, Who is fairest, tell me, who?""",N:N,H:N
snowdrop.emmood,And the glass answered:,N:N,H:N
snowdrop.emmood,"""Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween; But lovelier far is the new-made queen.""",N:N,H:N
snowdrop.emmood,"When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride.",A:A,F:A
snowdrop.emmood,"And when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her time of need.",H:A,H:H
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way off, a king who had three sons.",N:N,N:N
the_water_of_life.emmood,This king once fell very ill--so ill that nobody thought he could live.,Sa:N,N:N
the_water_of_life.emmood,"His sons were very much grieved at their father""s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and asked what was the matter.",Sa:Sa,S:S
the_water_of_life.emmood,"They told him that their father was very ill, and that they were afraid nothing could save him.",Sa:Sa,S:S
the_water_of_life.emmood,"""I know what would,"" said the little old man; ""it is the Water of Life.",H:N,N:S
the_water_of_life.emmood,"If he could have a draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.""",N:N,N:S
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Then the eldest son said, ""I will soon find it"": and he went to the sick king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as it was the only thing that could save him.",F:N,S:S
the_water_of_life.emmood,"""No,"" said the king.",N:N,S:S
the_water_of_life.emmood,"""I had rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in your journey.""",D:F,S:S
the_water_of_life.emmood,"But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the prince thought to himself, ""If I bring my father this water, he will make me sole heir to his kingdom.""",H:H,N:S
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said, ""Prince, whither so fast?""",F:Su-,N:N
the_water_of_life.emmood,"""What is that to thee, you ugly imp?"" said the prince haughtily, and rode on.",D:A,D:-
the_water_of_life.emmood,"But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round.",A:A,A:N
the_water_of_life.emmood,"He next tried to get off his horse and make his way on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.",Su-:F,-:N
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son""s return, till at last the second son said, ""Father, I will go in search of the Water of Life.""",F:N,N:N
the_water_of_life.emmood,"For he thought to himself, ""My brother is surely dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.""",H:H,N:N
the_water_of_life.emmood,"The king was at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.",N:A,N:N
the_water_of_life.emmood,"So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done, and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the mountains, saying, as before, ""Prince, prince, whither so fast?""",N:Su-,N:N
the_water_of_life.emmood,"""Mind your own affairs, busybody!"" said the prince scornfully, and rode on.",D:A,D:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the heart of the mountains.",N:N,D:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Thus it is with proud silly people, who think themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.",N:N,N:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should soon be able to make his father well again.",N:H,N:H
the_water_of_life.emmood,"So he set out, and the dwarf met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and said, ""Prince, whither so fast?""",N:N,N:N
the_water_of_life.emmood,"And the prince said, ""I am going in search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die: can you help me?",N:Su+,N:N
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!""",F:H,N:+
the_water_of_life.emmood,"""Do you know where it is to be found?"" asked the dwarf.",N:N,N:+
the_water_of_life.emmood,"""No,"" said the prince, ""I do not.",N:N,N:+
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Pray tell me if you know.""",N:H,N:+
the_water_of_life.emmood,"""Then as you have spoken to me kindly, and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to go.",H:H,N:+
the_water_of_life.emmood,"The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for ever.""",N:N,N:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey""s end, and found everything to be as the dwarf had told him.",H:N,N:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"The door flew open at the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall.",N:N,N:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,Around it he saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings and put them on his own fingers.,N:N,N:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"In another room he saw on a table a sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took.",N:N,N:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Further on he came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and marry her.",H:H,H:+
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life was in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he wanted before the clock struck twelve.",N:N,N:+
the_water_of_life.emmood,"He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself, as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on the lovely scenes around him.",N:N,N:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"So he laid himself down, and sleep fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was striking a quarter to twelve.",N:N,N:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full of water, and hastened to get away in time.",F:F,F:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Just as he was going out of the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him that it snapped off a piece of his heel.",Su-:N,-:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got the Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed by the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, ""You have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole armies, and the bread will never fail you.""",Su+:H,H:H
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Then the prince thought to himself, ""I cannot go home to my father without my brothers""; so he said, ""My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who set out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?""",N:Sa,N:H
the_water_of_life.emmood,"""I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,"" said the dwarf, ""because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.""",N:A,N:H
the_water_of_life.emmood,"The prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set them free, though unwillingly, saying, ""Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.""",A:A,H:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them, and told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water of Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful princess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to wait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.",H:H,H:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Then they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was feared all must die for want.",Su-:Sa,-:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"But the prince gave the king of the land the bread, and all his kingdom ate of it.",H:H,N:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"And he lent the king the wonderful sword, and he slew the enemy""s army with it; and thus the kingdom was once more in peace and plenty.",H:H,H:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,In the same manner he befriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.,N:N,N:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage the two eldest said to themselves, ""Our brother has got the water which we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the kingdom, which is our right""; so they were full of envy and revenge, and agreed together how they could ruin him.",A:A,A:F
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Then they waited till he was fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.",Su-:N,A:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"When they came to their journey""s end, the youngest son brought his cup to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed.",N:N,N:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Scarcely, however, had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father, but that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.",Su-:N,-:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his sickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.",N:H,N:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Then they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, ""Well, brother, you found the Water of Life, did you?",Su+:D,N:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,You have had the trouble and we shall have the reward.,H:H,N:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Pray, with all your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your eyes open?",N:H,N:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"Next year one of us will take away your beautiful princess, if you do not take care.",D:H,-:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"You had better say nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you say; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain: but be quiet, and we will let you off.""",D:N,-:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to be put to death.",A:A,A:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one day, when the king""s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the prince said, ""My friend, what is the matter with you?""",Sa:Sa,S:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"""I cannot and dare not tell you,"" said he.",Sa:Sa,S:A
the_water_of_life.emmood,"But the prince begged very hard, and said, ""Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will forgive you.""",F:N,S:A

90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then the youth took the plough, and just pressed it with one hand, but his grasp was so strong that the plough went deep into the earth.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The farmer could not bear to see that, and called to him, ""If thou art determined to plough, thou must not press so hard on it, that makes bad work.""",A:N,A:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The youth, however, unharnessed the horses, and drew the plough himself, saying, ""Just go home, father, and bid my mother make ready a large dish of food, and in the meantime I will go over the field.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then the farmer went home, and ordered his wife to prepare the food; but the youth ploughed the field which was two acres large, quite alone, and then he harnessed himself to the harrow, and harrowed the whole of the land, using two harrows at once.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When he had done it, he went into the forest, and pulled up two oak-trees, laid them across his shoulders, and hung on them one harrow behind and one before, and also one horse behind and one before, and carried all as if it had been a bundle of straw, to his parents"" house.",N:N,N:+
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When he entered the yard, his mother did not recognize him, and asked, ""Who is that horrible tall man?""",D:N,D:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The farmer said, ""That is our son.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"She said, ""No that cannot be our son, we never had such a tall one, ours was a little thing.""",D:N,D:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"She called to him, ""Go away, we do not want thee!""",D:N,D:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The youth was silent, but led his horses to the stable, gave them some oats and hay, and all that they wanted.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When he had done this, he went into the parlour, sat down on the bench and said, ""Mother, now I should like something to eat, will it soon be ready?""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then she said, ""Yes,"" and brought in two immense dishes full of food, which would have been enough to satisfy herself and her husband for a week.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The youth, however, ate the whole of it himself, and asked if she had nothing more to set before him.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"""No,"" she replied, ""that is all we have.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"""But that was only a taste, I must have more.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"She did not dare to oppose him, and went and put a huge caldron full of food on the fire, and when it was ready, carried it in.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"""At length come a few crumbs,"" said he, and ate all there was, but it was still not sufficient to appease his hunger.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then said he, ""Father, I see well that with you I shall never have food enough; if you will get me an iron staff which is strong, and which I cannot break against my knees, I will go out into the world.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The farmer was glad, put his two horses in his cart, and fetched from the smith a staff so large and thick, that the two horses could only just bring it away.",H:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The youth laid it across his knees, and snap! he broke it in two in the middle like a bean-stalk, and threw it away.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The father then harnessed four horses, and brought a bar which was so long and thick, that the four horses could only just drag it.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The son snapped this also in twain against his knees, threw it away, and said, ""Father, this can be of no use to me, you must harness more horses, and bring a stronger staff.""",D:N,D:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"So the father harnessed eight horses, and brought one which was so long and thick, that the eight horses could only just carry it.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When the son took it in his hand, he broke off a bit from the top of it also, and said, ""Father, I see that you will not be able to procure me any such staff as I want, I will remain no longer with you.""",D:N,D:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"So he went away, and gave out that he was a smith""s apprentice.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"He arrived at a village, wherein lived a smith who was a greedy fellow, who never did a kindness to any one, but wanted everything for himself.",N:N,N:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,The youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a journeyman.,N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"""Yes,"" said the smith, and looked at him, and thought, ""That is a strong fellow who will strike out well, and earn his bread.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"So he asked, ""How much wages dost thou want?""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"""I don""t want any at all,"" he replied, ""only every fortnight, when the other journeymen are paid, I will give thee two blows, and thou must bear them.""",N:N,N:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The miser was heartily satisfied, and thought he would thus save much money.",H:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Next morning, the strange journeyman was to begin to work, but when the master brought the glowing bar, and the youth struck his first blow, the iron flew asunder, and the anvil sank so deep into the earth, that there was no bringing it out again.",N:N,-:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then the miser grew angry, and said, ""Oh, but I can""t make any use of you, you strike far too powerfully; what will you have for the one blow?""",A:A,A:A
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then said he, ""I will only give you quite a small blow, that""s all.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"And he raised his foot, and gave him such a kick that he flew away over four loads of hay.",N:N,N:+
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then he sought out the thickest iron bar in the smithy for himself, took it as a stick in his hand and went onwards.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When he had walked for some time, he came to a small farm, and asked the bailiff if he did not require a head-servant.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"""Yes,"" said the bailiff, ""I can make use of one; you look a strong fellow who can do something, how much a year do you want as wages?""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"He again replied that he wanted no wages at all, but that every year he would give him three blows, which he must bear.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then the bailiff was satisfied, for he, too, was a covetous fellow.",H:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Next morning all the servants were to go into the wood, and the others were already up, but the head-servant was still in bed.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then one of them called to him, ""Get up, it is time; we are going into the wood, and thou must go with us.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"""Ah,"" said he quite roughly and surlily, ""you may just go, then; I shall be back again before any of you.""",A:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then the others went to the bailiff, and told him that the head-man was still lying in bed, and would not go into the wood with them.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The bailiff said they were to awaken him again, and tell him to harness the horses.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The head-man, however, said as before, ""Just go there, I shall be back again before any of you.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,And then he stayed in bed two hours longer.,N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"At length he arose from the feathers, but first he got himself two bushels of peas from the loft, made himself some broth with them, ate it at his leisure, and when that was done, went and harnessed the horses, and drove into the wood.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Not far from the wood was a ravine through which he had to pass, so he first drove the horses on, and then stopped them, and went behind the cart, took trees and brushwood, and made a great barricade, so that no horse could get through.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When he was entering the wood, the others were just driving out of it with their loaded carts to go home; then said he to them, ""Drive on, I will still get home before you do.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"He did not drive far into the wood, but at once tore two of the very largest trees of all out of the earth, threw them on his cart, and turned round.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When he came to the barricade, the others were still standing there, not able to get through.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"""Don""t you see,"" said he, ""that if you had stayed with me, you would have got home just as quickly, and would have had another hour""s sleep?""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"He now wanted to drive on, but his horeses could not work their way through, so he unharnessed them, laid them on the top of the cart, took the shafts in his own hands, and pulled it all through, and he did this just as easily as if it had been laden with feathers.",N:N,N:+
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When he was over, he said to the others, ""There, you see, I have got over quicker than you,"" and drove on, and the others had to stay where they were.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"In the yard, however, he took a tree in his hand, showed it to the bailiff, and said, ""Isn""t that a fine bundle of wood?""",N:N,N:+
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then said the bailiff to his wife, ""The servant is a good one, if he does sleep long, he is still home before the others.""",H:N,H:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"So he served the bailiff for a year, and when that was over, and the other servants were getting their wages, he said it was time for him to take his too.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The bailiff, however, was afraid of the blows which he was to receive, and earnestly entreated him to excuse him from having them; for rather than that, he himself would be head-servant, and the youth should be bailiff.",F:F,F:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"""No,"" said he, ""I will not be a bailiff, I am head-servant, and will remain so, but I will administer that which we agreed on.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The bailiff was willing to give him whatsoever he demanded, but it was of no use, the head-servant said no to everything.",N:N,F:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then the bailiff did not know what to do, and begged for a fortnight""s delay, for he wanted to find some way of escape.",F:N,F:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,The head-servant consented to this delay.,N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The bailiff summoned all his clerks together, and they were to think the matter over, and give him advice.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The clerks pondered for a long time, but at last they said that no one was sure of his life with the head-servant, for he could kill a man as easily as a midge, and that the bailiff ought to make him get into the well and clean it, and when he was down below, they would roll up one of the mill-stones which was lying there, and throw it on his head; and then he would never return to daylight.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The advice pleased the bailiff, and the head-servant was quite willing to go down the well.",H:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When he was standing down below at the bottom, they rolled down the largest mill-stone and thought they had broken his skull, but he cried, ""Chase away those hens from the well, they are scratching in the sand up there, and throwing the grains into my eyes, so that I can""t see.""",A:N,A:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"So the bailiff cried, ""Sh-sh,"" and pretended to frighten the hens away.",N:N,N:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When the head-servant had finished his work, he climbed up and said, ""Just look what a beautiful neck-tie I have on,"" and behold it was the mill-stone which he was wearing round his neck.",N:N,N:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The head-servant now wanted to take his reward, but the bailiff again begged for a fortnight""s delay.",F:N,F:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The clerks met together and advised him to send the head-servant to the haunted mill to grind corn by night, for from thence as yet no man had ever returned in the morning alive.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The proposal pleased the bailiff, he called the head-servant that very evening, and ordered him to take eight bushels of corn to the mill, and grind it that night, for it was wanted.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"So the head-servant went to the loft, and put two bushels in his right pocket, and two in his left, and took four in a wallet, half on his back, and half on his breast, and thus laden went to the haunted mill.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The miller told him that he could grind there very well by day, but not by night, for the mill was haunted, and that up to the present time whosoever had gone into it at night had been found in the morning lying dead inside.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"He said, ""I will manage it, just you go away to bed.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then he went into the mill, and poured out the corn.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"About eleven o""clock he went into the miller""s room, and sat down on the bench.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When he had sat there a while, a door suddenly opened, and a large table came in, and on the table, wine and roasted meats placed themselves, and much good food besides, but everything came of itself, for no one was there to carry it.",N:N,N:+
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"After this the chairs pushed themselves up, but no people came, until all at once he beheld fingers, which handled knives and forks, and laid food on the plates, but with this exception he saw nothing.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"As he was hungry, and saw the food, he, too, place himself at the table, ate with those who were eating and enjoyed it.",H:H,H:H
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When he had had enough, and the others also had quite emptied their dishes, he distinctly heard all the candles being suddenly snuffed out, and as it was now pitch dark, he felt something like a box on the ear.",N:N,-:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then he said, ""If anything of that kind comes again, I shall strike out in return.""",A:N,A:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"And when he had received a second box on the ear, he, too struck out.",N:N,A:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,And so it continued the whole night.,N:N,N:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"He took nothing without returning it, but repaid everything with interest, and did not lay about him in vain.",N:N,A:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"At daybreak, however, everything ceased.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When the miller had got up, he wanted to look after him, and wondered if he were still alive.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then the youth said, ""I have eaten my fill, have received some boxes on the ears, but I have given some in return.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"The miller rejoiced, and said that the mill was now released from the spell, and wanted to give him much money as a reward.",H:H,H:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"But he said, ""Money, I will not have, I have enough of it.""",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"So he took his meal on his back, went home, and told the bailiff that he had done what he had been told to do, and would now have the reward agreed on.",N:N,N:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"When the bailiff heard that, he was seriously alarmed and quite beside himself; he walked backwards and forwards in the room, and drops of perspiration ran down from his forehead.",F:N,F:N
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then he opened the window to get some fresh air, but before he was aware, the head-servant had given him such a kick that he flew through the window out into the air, and so far away that no one ever saw him again.",N:N,-:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then said the head-servant to the bailiff""s wife, ""If he does not come back, you must take the other blow.""",N:N,N:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"She cried, ""No, no I cannot bear it,"" and opened the other window, because drops of perspiration were running down her forehead.",F:F,F:F
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Then he gave her such a kick that she, too, flew out, and as she was lighter she went much higher than her husband.",N:N,-:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"Her husband cried, ""Do come to me,"" but she replied, ""Come thou to me, I cannot come to thee.""",N:N,N:-
90_the_young_giant.emmood,"And they hovered about there in the air, and could not get to each other, and whether they are still hovering about, or not, I do not know, but the young giant took up his iron bar, and went on his way.",N:N,N:N
the_turnip.emmood,There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and the other poor.,N:N,N:N
the_turnip.emmood,"The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so, pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well, and sowed turnips.",N:N,N:N
the_turnip.emmood,"When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for there never was such a one seen before, and never will again.",Su+:Su+,N:N
the_turnip.emmood,"At last it was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him.",Su+:Su+,N:N
the_turnip.emmood,"One day he said to himself, ""What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.""",N:A,N:N
the_turnip.emmood,"Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it to the king.",N:N,N:N
the_turnip.emmood,"""What a wonderful thing!"" said the king; ""I have seen many strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw.",H:H,H:N
the_turnip.emmood,Where did you get the seed? or is it only your good luck?,Su+:Su+,H:N
the_turnip.emmood,"If so, you are a true child of fortune.""",N:Su+,N:N
the_turnip.emmood,"""Ah, no!"" answered the gardener, ""I am no child of fortune; I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground.",N:Sa,N:N
the_turnip.emmood,"I have a brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.""",Sa:Sa,N:S

the_turnip.emmood,"I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother.""",H:H,N:H
the_turnip.emmood,"Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so rich that his brother""s fortune could not at all be compared with his.",N:H,N:H
the_turnip.emmood,"When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself.",A:A,N:F
the_turnip.emmood,"However, he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip, what must his present be wroth?",N:A,N:F
the_turnip.emmood,"The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.",Su+:H,+:+
the_turnip.emmood,"When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his brother.",A:A,A:F
the_turnip.emmood,"So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ""Dear brother, I have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between us.""",D:A,A:F

the_turnip.emmood,"But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away.",F:F,F:F
the_turnip.emmood,"Meantime he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out his head.",F:N,F:F

the_turnip.emmood,"The student looked about everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came from, cried out, ""Who calls me?""",F:Su-,N:+

the_turnip.emmood,"So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith, for his thirst for knowledge was great.",N:A,N:+

the_turnip.emmood,"As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ""Wait a while,"" said the gardener, ""that is not the way.""",N:N,N:H
the_turnip.emmood,"Then he pushed him in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom dangling in the air.",N:Su-,N:H

the_salad.emmood,"It so happened that his road one day led through a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow, and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young lady by her side looking about them.",N:N,H:N

the_salad.emmood,"So the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his pillow, for it lay now under the young lady""s, and the old woman took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his prize.",H:N,F:N

the_salad.emmood,"""If that""s all your grief,"" said the huntsman, ""I""ll take there with all my heart""; so he drew her under his cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they were both there.",H:N,S:H
the_salad.emmood,The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the finest.,H:H,H:H

the_salad.emmood,"Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as he saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, ""I can only save myself by feigning to be asleep""; so he laid himself down as if he were in a sound sleep.",F:N,F:N

the_salad.emmood,"However, he still felt very hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again.",H:H,H:H
the_salad.emmood,"Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and the bad salad, and thought to himself, ""This will help me to my fortune again, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.""",H:N,H:S
the_salad.emmood,So he went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering about a few days he luckily found it.,H:N,H:H

the_salad.emmood,"When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they longed to taste it, and said, ""Dear countryman, let us just taste it.""",Su+:N,F:N
the_salad.emmood,"""To be sure,"" answered he; ""I have two heads of it with me, and will give you one""; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad.",N:N,F:N
the_salad.emmood,"Then the witch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was ready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves immediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the form of an ass.",F:N,F:N
the_salad.emmood,"Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing the salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a wish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she also was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish with the salad fall on the ground.",F:N,F:N
the_salad.emmood,"The messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, ""I don""t know where the salad can be.""",Sa:N,F:N

the_salad.emmood,"And as he went he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad lying on the ground.",H:N,H:N
the_salad.emmood,"""All right!"" said he; ""those two have had their share.""",H:Su+,H:H
the_salad.emmood,"Then he took up the rest of the leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady, saying, ""I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.""",H:N,H:N
the_salad.emmood,"So she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying away.",F:N,H:N
the_salad.emmood,Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they might know him.,H:N,H:N
the_salad.emmood,"""Now you shall be paid for your roguery,"" said he; and tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he came to a mill and knocked at the window.",A:N,A:N
the_salad.emmood,"""What""s the matter?"" said the miller.",F:N,A:N
the_salad.emmood,"""I have three tiresome beasts here,"" said the other; ""if you will take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you, I will pay you whatever you ask.""",A:N,A:N
the_salad.emmood,"""With all my heart,"" said the miller; ""but how shall I treat them?""",Su+:N,A:N
the_salad.emmood,"Then the huntsman said, ""Give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no stripes"": for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.",A:N,A:N
the_salad.emmood,"After this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he wanted.",H:N,H:H
the_salad.emmood,"Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass was dead; ""The other two,"" said he, ""are alive and eat, but are so sorrowful that they cannot last long.""",Sa:N,H:N
the_salad.emmood,"Then the huntsman pitied them, and told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he gave them some of the good salad to eat.",Sa:N,H:N
the_salad.emmood,"And the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees before him, and said, ""O dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for I always loved you very much.",Sa:Sa,S:S
the_salad.emmood,"Your wishing-cloak hangs up in the closet, and as for the bird""s heart, I will give it you too.""",F:N,S:H

the_raven.emmood,"Once more the night came on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep.",N:N,N:S
the_raven.emmood,"Again the next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening, thinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep.",Su-:Su-,-:N
the_raven.emmood,"He waited till it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.",Su+:N,+:N
the_raven.emmood,"He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it.",Su-:Su-,-:-
the_raven.emmood,"He thought to himself, ""If the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.""",F:F,F:F
the_raven.emmood,"However, after a while he summoned up courage and went forward.",F:F,F:F
the_raven.emmood,"When the giant saw him, he called out, ""It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had anything to eat for a long time.",H:H,F:F
the_raven.emmood,"I can have you now for my supper.""",H:H,F:F
the_raven.emmood,"""I would rather you let that alone,"" said the man, ""for I do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your hunger.""",F:F,F:F
the_raven.emmood,"""If that is so,"" replied the giant, ""I will leave you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.""",H:H,N:H

the_raven.emmood,"The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and ate and drank to his heart""s content.",H:H,H:H
the_raven.emmood,When he had finished his supper the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.,N:N,N:H
the_raven.emmood,"The giant said, ""I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns, villages, and houses.""",N:N,N:N
the_raven.emmood,"So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle, but could not find it.",N:N,N:-
the_raven.emmood,"""Never mind,"" he said, ""I have larger maps upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,"" but they searched in vain, for the castle was not marked even on these.",D:Sa,D:S
the_raven.emmood,"The man now thought he should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was away in search of provisions.",N:Sa,N:S
the_raven.emmood,"When the brother came home, they asked him about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger.",N:N,N:N
the_raven.emmood,"Accordingly, when he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found.",D:Sa,D:S
the_raven.emmood,"Then he fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away.",Sa:Sa,S:S
the_raven.emmood,"""How shall I be able to get there?"" asked the man.",Sa:Sa,S:S
the_raven.emmood,"""I have two hours to spare,"" said the giant, ""and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I must then return to look after the child who is in our care.""",Su+:N,N:S
the_raven.emmood,"The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues of the castle, where he left him, saying, ""You will be able to walk the remainder of the way yourself.""",N:N,N:N
the_raven.emmood,The man journeyed on day and night till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg.,N:N,N:H
the_raven.emmood,"He found it situated, however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside.",N:Su-,N:-
the_raven.emmood,"He was overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again.",H:H,H:S
the_raven.emmood,"When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, ""I will remain here and wait for her,"" so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king""s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.",Sa:Sa,S:S
the_raven.emmood,"Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he called out to them, ""God be with you.""",N:N,N:S
the_raven.emmood,"They stopped when they heard the call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their fighting, which now became more furious.",A:A,A:S
the_raven.emmood,"""God be with you,"" he cried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back to their fighting.",A:A,A:S
the_raven.emmood,"A third time he called out, ""God be with you,"" and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so angrily with one another.",N:Su-,N:-
the_raven.emmood,"One of them said that he had found a stick, and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he wished to pass, and it immediately flew open.",N:N,N:N
the_raven.emmood,"Another told him that he had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even up the glass mountain.",N:N,N:N
the_raven.emmood,"They had been unable to decide whether they would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would separate.",N:A,N:N
the_raven.emmood,"On hearing this, the man said, ""I will give you something in exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got, but something that is of far more value.",Su+:N,+:N
the_raven.emmood,"I must first, however, prove whether all you have told me about your three things is true.""",N:N,N:N
the_raven.emmood,"The robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer visible.",N:N,N:N
the_raven.emmood,"Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after another, crying, ""There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!""",H:A,H:+
the_raven.emmood,After this he rode up the glass mountain.,N:N,H:H
the_raven.emmood,"When he reached the gate of the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick, and it flew wide open at once and he passed through.",N:N,H:H
the_raven.emmood,"He mounted the steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden goblet full of wine in front of her.",N:N,H:H
the_raven.emmood,She could not see him for he still wore his cloak.,N:N,H:H
the_raven.emmood,"He took the ring which she had given him off his finger, and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.",N:N,H:H
the_raven.emmood,"""That is my own ring,"" she exclaimed, ""and if that is so the man must also be here who is coming to set me free.""",Su+:H,+:H
the_raven.emmood,"She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.",N:Sa,N:H
the_raven.emmood,Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off the cloak.,N:N,N:H
the_raven.emmood,"When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and cried aloud for joy.",H:H,H:H
the_raven.emmood,"Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and she kissed him, and said, ""Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow we will celebrate our marriage.""",H:H,H:H

clever_elsie.emmood,"When they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ""Elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.""",N:N,N:N

clever_elsie.emmood,"When she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury.",H:N,H:N
clever_elsie.emmood,"Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left there.",F:N,F:N
clever_elsie.emmood,"Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ""If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.""",F:Sa,F:S

clever_elsie.emmood,"The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down.",Sa:N,S:N
clever_elsie.emmood,"Then said the mother likewise: ""What a clever Elsie we have!"" and sat down and wept with them.",Sa:Sa,S:S
clever_elsie.emmood,"The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ""I must go into the cellar myself and see where Elsie is.""",A:N,S:N

3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"They were so poor, however, that they no longer had daily bread, and did not know how to get food for her.",N:N,S:S
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"One morning the wood-cutter went out sorrowfully to his work in the forest, and while he was cutting wood, suddenly there stood before him a tall and beautiful woman with a crown of shining stars on her head, who said to him, ""I am the Virgin Mary, mother of the child Jesus.",Sa:Sa,S:S
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Thou art poor and needy, bring thy child to me, I will take her with me and be her mother, and care for her.""",N:N,N:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"The wood-cutter obeyed, brought his child, and gave her to the Virgin Mary, who took her up to heaven with her.",N:N,N:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"There the child fared well, ate sugar-cakes, and drank sweet milk, and her clothes were of gold, and the little angels played with her.",H:N,H:H
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"And when she was fourteen years of age, the Virgin Mary called her one day and said, ""Dear child, I am about to make a long journey, so take into thy keeping the keys of the thirteen doors of heaven.",N:N,N:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Twelve of these thou mayest open, and behold the glory which is within them, but the thirteenth, to which this little key belongs, is forbidden thee.",N:N,N:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Beware of opening it, or thou wilt bring misery on thyself.""",N:N,N:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"The girl promised to be obedient, and when the Virgin Mary was gone, she began to examine the dwellings of the kingdom of heaven.",N:N,N:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Each day she opened one of them, until she had made the round of the twelve.",N:N,N:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"In each of them sat one of the Apostles in the midst of a great light, and she rejoiced in all the magnificence and splendour, and the little angels who always accompanied her rejoiced with her.",H:H,H:H
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then the forbidden door alone remained, and she felt a great desire to know what could be hidden behind it, and said to the angels, ""I will not quite open it, and I will not go inside it, but I will unlock it so that we can just see a little through the opening.""",N:N,N:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"""Oh no,"" said the little angels, ""that would be a sin.",D:F,D:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"The Virgin Mary has forbidden it, and it might easily cause thy unhappiness.""",D:N,D:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then she was silent, but the desire in her heart was not stilled, but gnawed there and tormented her, and let her have no rest.",A:Sa,D:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"And once when the angels had all gone out, she thought, ""Now I am quite alone, and I could peep in.",N:N,N:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"If I do it, no one will ever know.""",N:N,N:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"She sought out the key, and when she had got it in her hand, she put it in the lock, and when she had put it in, she turned it round as well.",N:N,N:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then the door sprang open, and she saw there the Trinity sitting in fire and splendour.",N:N,+:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"She stayed there awhile, and looked at everything in amazement; then she touched the light a little with her finger, and her finger became quite golden.",Su+:N,+:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,Immediately a great fear fell on her.,F:F,F:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"She shut the door violently, and ran away.",N:N,F:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Her terror too would not quit her, let her do what she might, and her heart beat continually and would not be still; the gold too stayed on her finger, and would not go away, let her rub it and wash it never so much.",F:F,F:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,It was not long before the Virgin Mary came back from her journey.,N:N,N:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"She called the girl before her, and asked to have the keys of heaven back.",N:N,N:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"When the maiden gave her the bunch, the Virgin looked into her eyes and said, ""Hast thou not opened the thirteenth door also?""",N:N,N:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"""No,"" she replied.",F:N,F:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then she laid her hand on the girl""s heart, and felt how it beat and beat, and saw right well that she had disobeyed her order and had opened the door.",N:N,N:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then she said once again, ""Art thou certain that thou hast not done it?""",A:N,A:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"""Yes,"" said the girl, for the second time.",F:N,F:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then she perceived the finger which had become golden from touching the fire of heaven, and saw well that the child had sinned, and said for the third time ""Hast thou not done it?""",A:N,A:A
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"""No,"" said the girl for the third time.",F:N,F:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then said the Virgin Mary, ""Thou hast not obeyed me, and besides that thou hast lied, thou art no longer worthy to be in heaven.""",A:N,A:A
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then the girl fell into a deep sleep, and when she awoke she lay on the earth below, and in the midst of a wilderness.",N:N,N:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"She wanted to cry out, but she could bring forth no sound.",Sa:Sa,S:S
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"She sprang up and wanted to run away, but whithersoever she turned herself, she was continually held back by thick hedges of thorns through which she could not break.",N:N,S:F
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"In the desert, in which she was imprisoned, there stood an old hollow tree, and this had to be her dwelling-place.",N:N,S:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Into this she crept when night came, and here she slept.",N:N,S:S
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Here, too, she found a shelter from storm and rain, but it was a miserable life, and bitterly did she weep when she remembered how happy she had been in heaven, and how the angels had played with her.",Sa:Sa,S:S
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Roots and wild berries were her only food, and for these she sought as far as she could go.",N:N,S:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"In the autumn she picked up the fallen nuts and leaves, and carried them into the hole.",N:N,S:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"The nuts were her food in winter, and when snow and ice came, she crept amongst the leaves like a poor little animal that she might not freeze.",N:N,S:S
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Before long her clothes were all torn, and one bit of them after another fell off her.",N:N,S:S
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"As soon, however, as the sun shone warm again, she went out and sat in front of the tree, and her long hair covered her on all sides like a mantle.",N:N,N:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Thus she sat year after year, and felt the pain and the misery of the world.",Sa:N,S:S
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"One day, when the trees were once more clothed in fresh green, the King of the country was hunting in the forest, and followed a roe, and as it had fled into the thicket which shut in this part of the forest, he got off his horse, tore the bushes asunder, and cut himself a path with his sword.",N:N,N:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"When he had at last forced his way through, he saw a wonderfully beautiful maiden sitting under the tree; and she sat there and was entirely covered with her golden hair down to her very feet.",Su+:N,+:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"He stood still and looked at her full of surprise, then he spoke to her and said, ""Who art thou?",Su+:Su+,+:H
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Why art thou sitting here in the wilderness?""",N:N,+:N

3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"The King continued, ""Wilt thou go with me to my castle?""",N:N,+:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,Then she just nodded her head a little.,N:N,N:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"The King took her in his arms, carried her to his horse, and rode home with her, and when he reached the royal castle he caused her to be dressed in beautiful garments, and gave her all things in abundance.",N:N,+:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Although she could not speak, she was still so beautiful and charming that he began to love her with all his heart, and it was not long before he married her.",H:N,H:H
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"After a year or so had passed, the Queen brought a son into the world.",N:N,H:H
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Thereupon the Virgin Mary appeared to her in the night when she lay in her bed alone, and said, ""If thou wilt tell the truth and confess that thou didst unlock the forbidden door, I will open thy mouth and give thee back thy speech, but if thou perseverest in thy sin, and deniest obstinately, I will take thy new-born child away with me.""",N:N,N:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then the queen was permitted to answer, but she remained hard, and said, ""No, I did not open the forbidden door;"" and the Virgin Mary took the new-born child from her arms, and vanished with it.",N:N,-:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Next morning when the child was not to be found, it was whispered among the people that the Queen was a man-eater, and had killed her own child.",N:N,-:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"She heard all this and could say nothing to the contrary, but the King would not believe it, for he loved her so much.",N:N,-:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"When a year had gone by the Queen again bore a son, and in the night the Virgin Mary again came to her, and said, ""If thou wilt confess that thou openedst the forbidden door, I will give thee thy child back and untie thy tongue; but if you continuest in sin and deniest it, I will take away with me this new child also.""",N:N,N:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then the Queen again said, ""No, I did not open the forbidden door;"" and the Virgin took the child out of her arms, and away with her to heaven.",N:N,-:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Next morning, when this child also had disappeared, the people declared quite loudly that the Queen had devoured it, and the King""s councillors demanded that she should be brought to justice.",A:A,A:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"The King, however, loved her so dearly that he would not believe it, and commanded the councillors under pain of death not to say any more about it.",A:N,A:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"The following year the Queen gave birth to a beautiful little daughter, and for the third time the Virgin Mary appeared to her in the night and said, ""Follow me.""",N:N,N:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"She took the Queen by the hand and led her to heaven, and showed her there her two eldest children, who smiled at her, and were playing with the ball of the world.",N:N,N:H
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"When the Queen rejoiced thereat, the Virgin Mary said, ""Is thy heart not yet softened?",H:H,H:H
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"If thou wilt own that thou openedst the forbidden door, I will give thee back thy two little sons.""",N:N,N:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"But for the third time the Queen answered, ""No, I did not open the forbidden door.""",N:N,N:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then the Virgin let her sink down to earth once more, and took from her likewise her third child.",N:N,-:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Next morning, when the loss was reported abroad, all the people cried loudly, ""The Queen is a man-eater.",N:N,D:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"She must be judged,"" and the King was no longer able to restrain his councillors.",D:N,D:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Thereupon a trial was held, and as she could not answer, and defend herself, she was condemned to be burnt alive.",N:N,D:-
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"The wood was got together, and when she was fast bound to the stake, and the fire began to burn round about her, the hard ice of pride melted, her heart was moved by repentance, and she thought, ""If I could but confess before my death that I opened the door.""",F:N,F:S
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then her voice came back to her, and she cried out loudly, ""Yes, Mary, I did it;"" and straight-way rain fell from the sky and extinguished the flames of fire, and a light broke forth above her, and the Virgin Mary descended with the two little sons by her side, and the new-born daughter in her arms.",F:F,F:H
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"She spoke kindly to her, and said, ""He who repents his sin and acknowledges it, is forgiven.""",H:N,H:N
3_our_ladys_child.emmood,"Then she gave her the three children, untied her tongue, and granted her happiness for her whole life.",N:N,H:H
iron_hans.emmood,"There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals.",N:N,N:N
iron_hans.emmood,"One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back.",F:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"""Perhaps some accident has befallen him,"" said the king, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.",F:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: ""Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all three.""",F:F,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again.",F:N,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it.",N:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"This lasted for many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest.",N:N,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"The king, however, would not give his consent, and said: ""It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others, and you would never come out again.""",F:F,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"The huntsman replied: ""Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.""",A:F,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest.,N:N,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under.",F:N,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water.",F:N,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees.",D:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle.",N:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"There was great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping.",Su-:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,And from this time forth everyone could again go into the forest with safety.,H:N,H:N
iron_hans.emmood,"The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.",Sa:N,H:N
iron_hans.emmood,"The boy ran thither and said: ""Give me my ball out.""",A:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"""Not till you have opened the door for me,"" answered the man.",A:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"""No,"" said the boy, ""I will not do that; the king has forbidden it,"" and ran away.",A:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"The next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: ""Open my door,"" but the boy would not.",F:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said: ""I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.""",Sa:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"Then the wild man said: ""It lies under your mother""s pillow, you can get it there.""",N:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key.",Sa:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers.",Sa:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away.",H:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: ""Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!""",F:F,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest.",N:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"When the king came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen how that had happened.",A:N,A:F
iron_hans.emmood,"She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was gone.",Su-:N,A:F
iron_hans.emmood,"She called the boy, but no one answered.",F:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him.",F:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.",Sa:Sa,S:S
iron_hans.emmood,"When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him: ""You will never see your father and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free, and I have compassion on you.",Sa:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"If you do all I bid you, you shall fare well.",H:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the world.""",H:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the next morning the man took him to a well, and said: ""Behold, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted.",F:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"I will come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.""",N:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"The boy placed himself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.",F:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water.",Sa:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"He drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose.",F:N,F:-
iron_hans.emmood,"In the evening Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said: ""What has happened to the well?""",A:A,F:A
iron_hans.emmood,"""Nothing nothing,"" he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it.",F:F,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"But he said: ""You have dipped your finger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let anything go in.""",A:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it.,N:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well.",F:Sa,F:S
iron_hans.emmood,"He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded.",F:N,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"Iron Hans came, and already knew what had happened.",A:N,F:A
iron_hans.emmood,"""You have let a hair fall into the well,"" said he.",A:N,F:A
iron_hans.emmood,"""I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with me.""",A:N,F:A
iron_hans.emmood,"On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger, however much it hurt him.",F:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"But the time was long to him, and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water.",Sa:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"And as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water.",Su-:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun.",Su-:N,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,You can imagine how terrified the poor boy was!,F:F,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"He took his pockethandkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man might not see it.",F:N,F:F
iron_hans.emmood,"When he came he already knew everything, and said: ""Take the handkerchief off.""",A:N,A:A
iron_hans.emmood,"Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use.",Sa:N,A:F
iron_hans.emmood,"""You have not stood the trial and can stay here no longer.",A:N,A:A
iron_hans.emmood,"Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.",A:N,A:A
iron_hans.emmood,"But as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry: ""Iron Hans,"" and then I will come and help you.",Sa:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"My power is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in abundance.""",N:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"Then the king""s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city.",N:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"There he looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he could help himself.",Sa:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"At length he went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in.",N:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"The people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay.",Su+:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"At length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders together.",N:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on.",F:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"Such a thing as that had never yet come under the king""s notice, and he said: ""When you come to the royal table you must take your hat off.""",A:N,F:A
iron_hans.emmood,"He answered: ""Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my head.""",F:N,F:N
iron_hans.emmood,"Then the king had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to send him away at once.",A:A,F:A
iron_hans.emmood,"The cook, however, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener""s boy.",Sa:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather.",Sa:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"Once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him.",N:N,S:N
iron_hans.emmood,"As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king""s daughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be.",Su+:N,+:N
iron_hans.emmood,"Then she saw the boy, and cried to him: ""Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.""",Su+:N,+:N

the_pink.emmood,"The thought occurred to him, however, that the king""s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril.",F:F,F:F

the_pink.emmood,"The king said yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the district or country.",N:N,N:N
the_pink.emmood,Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the royal table.,N:N,N:N
the_pink.emmood,"So he summoned all the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.",N:N,N:N

the_pink.emmood,"Whilst he was sitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the king""s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished.",Sa:Sa,S:S
the_pink.emmood,"Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began, and said: ""Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen living in the tower?",H:N,H:N

the_pink.emmood,"But the king replied: ""She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will not have her named.""",N:A,N:A

the_pink.emmood,"Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said: ""That is the wretch!"" and caused live coals to be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat.",N:A,N:A

the_pink.emmood,"When the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon.",A:A,A:A

the_pink.emmood,"The son said: ""Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower,"" and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.",H:H,H:H
the_pink.emmood,"Then the son said: ""Now will I show her to you in her own form,"" and wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.",N:N,N:N

the_seven_ravens.emmood,What was to be done?,N:N,F:F
the_seven_ravens.emmood,"She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.",Sa:N,F:-

frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"When dinner-time drew nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and put it on the fire to fry.",N:N,N:N

frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"""Ah! well,"" said she, ""when one goes another may as well follow.""",D:Su-,N:N

frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"""O Frederick!"" answered she, ""I was cooking you a steak; but while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!""",D:H,N:N
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"""Kate, Kate,"" said he, ""how could you do all this?""",A:Su-,A:N
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?""",A:Su-,A:N

frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side as they passed.",N:N,N:N
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"""Ah, see now,"" said she, ""how they have bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.""",N:Sa,N:S

frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"""Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,"" said Frederick, ""and bring with you something to eat.""",D:A,A:N
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way, ""Frederick wants something to eat; but I don""t think he is very fond of butter and cheese: I""ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar, for I have often seen him take some.""",N:H,N:N
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she took off the hinges, and said, ""Frederick told me to lock the door, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.""",Su-:N,N:N

frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"""Alas! alas!"" said he, ""what a clever wife I have!",Su-:A,-:N

frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"""Very well,"" answered she, ""I""ll carry the door; but I""ll not carry the nuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if you please, I""ll fasten them to the door.""",N:N,A:N
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.",N:N,N:N
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they were looking for.",N:Su+,N:N
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired; so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and Catherine were.",N:N,N:N
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up some stones.",N:N,N:N
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on the head with them: but they only said, ""It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir-apples down.""",N:Su-,N:N
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired; but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said softly, ""Frederick, I must let the nuts go.""",N:Sa,N:N

frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"""Well, then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.""",A:A,D:F
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"Then away rattled the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ""Bless me, it is hailing.""",D:Su+,D:F
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy: so she whispered to Frederick, ""I must throw the vinegar down.""",N:Sa,N:F
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"""Pray don""t,"" answered he, ""it will discover us.""",D:A,N:F
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"""I can""t help that,"" said she, ""go it must.""",D:Sa,N:F
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves said, ""What a heavy dew there is!""",N:Su-,N:F
frederick_and_catherine.emmood,"At last it popped into Catherine""s head that it was the door itself that was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ""Frederick, I must throw the door down soon.""",N:Sa,N:F

the_white_snake.emmood,"But when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth.",H:H,H:H
the_white_snake.emmood,No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window.,N:N,N:-
the_white_snake.emmood,"He went and listened, and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods.",N:N,N:+
the_white_snake.emmood,Eating the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.,N:N,N:+
the_white_snake.emmood,"Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty servant, who was allowed to go everywhere.",N:N,N:S
the_white_snake.emmood,"The king ordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed.",A:A,A:A
the_white_snake.emmood,In vain he declared his innocence; he was dismissed with no better answer.,F:Sa,F:S
the_white_snake.emmood,In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble.,F:F,F:F
the_white_snake.emmood,"Now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a confidential conversation together.",H:N,H:H
the_white_snake.emmood,The servant stood by and listened.,N:N,N:N
the_white_snake.emmood,"They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: ""Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen""s window.""",Sa:Sa,S:S
the_white_snake.emmood,"The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the kitchen, and said to the cook: ""Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.""",N:N,N:-

the_white_snake.emmood,"So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the spit, the queen""s ring was found inside her.",N:N,N:+
the_white_snake.emmood,"The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for.",H:N,H:H
the_white_snake.emmood,"The servant refused everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as he had a mind to see the world and go about a little.",N:N,N:H
the_white_snake.emmood,"When his request was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water.",N:Sa,N:S
the_white_snake.emmood,"Now, though it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the water.",F:Sa,F:S
the_white_snake.emmood,"They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ""We will remember you and repay you for saving us!""",H:H,H:H
the_white_snake.emmood,"He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet.",N:N,N:N

the_white_snake.emmood,"What can we do, but lie here and starve?""",N:N,N:S
the_white_snake.emmood,"So the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave it to them for food.",N:N,N:N
the_white_snake.emmood,"Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and cried: ""We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!""",H:H,H:H

the_white_snake.emmood,"Many had already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth saw the king""s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.",N:H,N:H
the_white_snake.emmood,"So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the bottom of the sea, and added: ""If you come up again without it you will be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.""",N:N,N:-

the_white_snake.emmood,"But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: ""Although he has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.""",N:N,N:D
the_white_snake.emmood,"The youth did not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever, as long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding it.",N:N,N:S
the_white_snake.emmood,"After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep.",N:N,N:N

91_the_gnome.emmood,"When it was evening the two brothers came and asked how he had got on, and he said, ""pretty well so far,"" and that he had seen no one except at mid-day when a little mannikin had come and begged for a piece of bread, that he had given some to him, but that the mannikin had let it fall and had asked him to pick it up again; but as he did not choose to do that, the elf had begun to lose his temper, and that he had done what he ought not, and had given the elf a beating, on which he had told him where the King""s daughters were.",N:N,N:N

91_the_gnome.emmood,"Then the second seated himself in the basket, but he did just the same as the first, and then it was the turn of the youngest, but he let himself be lowered quite to the bottom.",N:N,N:N
91_the_gnome.emmood,"When he had got out of the basket, he took his hanger, and went and stood outside the first door and listened, and heard the dragon snoring quite loudly.",N:N,N:N
91_the_gnome.emmood,"He opened the door slowly, and one of the princesses was sitting there, and had nine dragon""s heads lying upon her lap, and was combing them.",N:N,N:N

91_the_gnome.emmood,"Then he rang very loud, so that those above heard him, and he placed the princesses one after the other in the basket, and had them all drawn up, but when it came to his own turn he remembered the words of the elf, who had told him that his comrades did not mean well by him.",N:N,N:F
91_the_gnome.emmood,"So he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the King, and each demanded a princess in marriage.",N:N,N:S
91_the_gnome.emmood,"In the meantime the youngest huntsman was wandering about the three chambers in great trouble, fully expecting to have to end his days there, when he saw, hanging on the wall, a flute; then said he, ""Why dost thou hang there, no one can be merry here?""",Su+:Sa,+:S

91_the_gnome.emmood,"And he went out, listened at the door, and heard everything.",N:N,N:N
91_the_gnome.emmood,"Then he caused the two brothers to be hanged on the gallows, and to the third he gave his youngest daughter, and on that occasion I wore a pair of glass shoes, and I struck them against a stone, and they said, ""Klink,"" and were broken.",A:N,A:H

the_king_of_the_golden_mountain.emmood,"""Fair and softly,"" said the little old man; ""right is right; I have paid my money, and your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.""",N:N,N:A
the_king_of_the_golden_mountain.emmood,"""You must have my consent to that first,"" said Heinel, ""so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.""",N:N,N:A
the_king_of_the_golden_mountain.emmood,"The old man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could.",H:A,H:A
the_king_of_the_golden_mountain.emmood,"Then at last, after a long talk, they came to terms.",N:N,N:N
the_king_of_the_golden_mountain.emmood,"Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his company.",N:N,N:N
the_king_of_the_golden_mountain.emmood,"So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather.",N:N,N:N
the_king_of_the_golden_mountain.emmood,"Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge.",Sa:Sa,S:S
the_king_of_the_golden_mountain.emmood,"The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on.",N:N,N:+
the_king_of_the_golden_mountain.emmood,"The young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown land.",N:H,N:H

the_king_of_the_golden_mountain.emmood,"""Here,"" said he to himself, ""must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.""",N:N,N:H

the_king_of_the_golden_mountain.emmood,"The second night twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who will even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their power is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the Water of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life and health.""",N:N,N:S

the_twelve_dancing_princesses.emmood,"When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses, and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ""Now all is quite safe""; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed.",N:N,N:N
the_twelve_dancing_princesses.emmood,"In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home.",N:H,N:H

the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,"""Then I will try my skill,"" said the thief, and went and stole her away from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know it, but went on snoring.",H:H,H:+
the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for he awoke and missed the princess.,Su-:A,-:F
the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,"But when he got over the boat, and wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down dead.",H:H,H:+
the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,"They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea upon a few planks.",F:F,F:F
the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,"So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe.",H:H,H:H
the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,"When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ""One of you shall marry her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.""",H:H,H:H
the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,"Then there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ""If I had not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use; therefore she ought to be mine.""",A:A,A:-

the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,"""And if I had not sewn the boat together again,"" said the tailor, ""you would all have been drowned, therefore she is mine.""",A:A,A:-
the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,"Then the king put in a word, and said, ""Each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better.",Su-:Su+,-:+
the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,"But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a reward for his skill, half a kingdom.""",N:H,N:+
the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,So the brothers agreed that this plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have them.,H:H,H:+
the_four_clever_brothers.emmood,"And the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again.",H:H,H:H
old_sultan.emmood,"A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth.",N:N,N:N
old_sultan.emmood,"And one day when the shepherd and his wife were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ""I will shoot old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.""",N:N,N:N
old_sultan.emmood,"But his wife said, ""Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of his days.""",Sa:Sa,N:N
old_sultan.emmood,"""But what can we do with him?"" said the shepherd, ""he has not a tooth in his head, and the thieves don""t care for him at all; to be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.""",D:A,N:N
old_sultan.emmood,"Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows, and how his master meant to kill him in the morning.",F:F,F:S
old_sultan.emmood,"""Make yourself easy,"" said the wolf, ""I will give you some good advice.",N:N,N:N
old_sultan.emmood,"Your master, you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work.",N:N,N:N
old_sultan.emmood,"Now do you lie down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as long as you live.""",N:N,N:N
old_sultan.emmood,The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed.,H:H,H:H
old_sultan.emmood,"The wolf ran with the child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master and mistress.",N:N,H:H
old_sultan.emmood,"Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ""Old Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat.",H:N,H:H
old_sultan.emmood,"Wife, go home, and give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on as long as he lives.""",N:N,H:H
old_sultan.emmood,So from this time forward Sultan had all that he could wish for.,H:H,H:H
old_sultan.emmood,"Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ""Now, my good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way when I want to taste one of the old shepherd""s fine fat sheep.""",N:N,N:H
old_sultan.emmood,"""No,"" said the Sultan; ""I will be true to my master.""",A:N,A:N
old_sultan.emmood,"However, the wolf thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel.",N:N,N:N
old_sultan.emmood,"But Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed his locks for him finely.",N:N,N:N
old_sultan.emmood,"Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ""an old rogue,"" and swore he would have his revenge.",A:A,A:F
old_sultan.emmood,So the next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter.,A:N,A:F
old_sultan.emmood,"Now Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd""s old three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.",N:F,N:F
old_sultan.emmood,"The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat""s long tail standing straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped up into a tree.",F:Su-,F:F
old_sultan.emmood,"Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and wondered that no one was there.",Su-:Su+,N:F
old_sultan.emmood,"The boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ""Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame.""",A:Su+,A:+
old_sultan.emmood,"So they looked up, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.",A:A,A:+

22_the_riddle.emmood,"""Take that to your master,"" said she.",N:N,N:N
22_the_riddle.emmood,"But at that instant the glass broke and the poison spirted on the horse, and it was so strong that the animal immediately fell down dead.",N:N,-:-

22_the_riddle.emmood,By nightfall they found an inn and entered it.,N:N,N:N

22_the_riddle.emmood,"Hardly, however, had they swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, before they all fell down dead, for the raven had communicated to them the poison from the horse-flesh.",N:N,-:-

22_the_riddle.emmood,"After they had traveled about for a long time, they came to a town in which was a beautiful but proud princess, who had caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever should set her a riddle which she could not guess, that man should be her husband; but if she guessed it, his head must be cut off.",N:N,N:N

22_the_riddle.emmood,"As she did not know how to help herself, she ordered her maid to creep into the lord""s sleeping-chamber, and listen to his dreams, and thought that he would perhaps speak in his sleep and discover the riddle.",N:N,N:N
22_the_riddle.emmood,"But the clever servant had placed himself in the bed instead of his master, and when the maid came there, he tore off from her the mantle in which she had wrapped herself, and chased her out with rods.",A:N,N:-

22_the_riddle.emmood,"Now the master believed himself safe for the third night, and lay down in his own bed.",N:N,N:N
22_the_riddle.emmood,"Then came the princess herself, and she had put on a misty-grey mantle, and she seated herself near him.",N:N,N:-
22_the_riddle.emmood,"And when she thought that he was asleep and dreaming, she spoke to him, and hoped that he would answer in his sleep, as many do, but he was awake, and understood and heard everything quite well.",N:N,N:-
22_the_riddle.emmood,"Then she asked, ""One slew none, what is that?""",N:N,N:N
22_the_riddle.emmood,"He replied, ""A raven, which ate of a dead and poisoned horse, and died of it.""",N:N,N:N
22_the_riddle.emmood,"She inquired further, ""And yet slew twelve, what is that?""",N:N,N:N
22_the_riddle.emmood,"He answered, ""That means twelve murderers, who ate the raven and died of it.""",N:N,N:N
22_the_riddle.emmood,"When she knew the answer to the riddle she wanted to steal away, but he held her mantle so fast that she was forced to leave it behind her.",Su-:N,-:-
22_the_riddle.emmood,"Next morning, the King""s daughter announced that she had guessed the riddle, and sent for the twelve judges and expounded it before them.",N:N,N:-

the_golden_bird.emmood,"A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples.",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"These apples were always counted, and about the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone.",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree.",A:A,A:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"The gardener set his eldest son to watch; but about twelve o""clock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing.",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another apple was gone.",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch.",F:F,F:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener""s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it.",F:Su+,F:+
the_golden_bird.emmood,"But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.",N:Su-,N:+
the_golden_bird.emmood,"The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called together.",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ""One feather is of no use to me, I must have the whole bird.""",D:A,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then the gardener""s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his bow and made ready to shoot at it.",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then the fox said, ""Do not shoot me, for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and that you want to find the golden bird.",F:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"You will reach a village in the evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean.""",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"But the son thought to himself, ""What can such a beast as this know about the matter?""",D:Su-,D:-
the_golden_bird.emmood,"So he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and ran into the wood.",N:N,N:-
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then he went his way, and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty, and poor.",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"""I should be very silly,"" said he, ""if I went to that shabby house, and left this charming place""; so he went into the smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.",H:H,N:-
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened to him.",N:N,N:-
the_golden_bird.emmood,"He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and his country in the same manner.",H:N,H:-
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his coming back.",F:F,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard the same good counsel.",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"But he was thankful to the fox, and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ""Sit upon my tail, and you will travel faster.""",H:H,H:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"So he sat down, and the fox began to run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair whistled in the wind.",N:N,H:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"When they came to the village, the son followed the fox""s counsel, and without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all night at his ease.",N:H,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"In the morning came the fox again and met him as he was beginning his journey, and said, ""Go straight forward, till you come to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage; close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise you will repent it.""",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been lost were lying close by it.",N:Su+,N:+
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then thought he to himself, ""It will be a very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage""; so he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.",N:N,N:N
the_golden_bird.emmood,"But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and they took him prisoner and carried him before the king.",Su-:Su-,-:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"The next morning the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird given him for his own.",F:Su+,-:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair, when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ""You see now what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel.",Sa:Sa,S:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"I will still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as I bid you.",N:N,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.""",N:N,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then the son sat down on the fox""s tail, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.",N:N,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden saddle.",N:N,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity to put the leathern saddle upon it.",N:Sa,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"""I will give him the good one,"" said he; ""I am sure he deserves it.""",N:N,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"As he took up the golden saddle the groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court to be judged, and was sentenced to die.",Su-:Su-,-:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"But it was agreed, that, if he could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the bird and the horse given him for his own.",N:N,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ""Why did not you listen to me?",Sa:Sa,S:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"If you had, you would have carried away both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel.",N:N,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Go straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle.",N:N,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"At twelve o""clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.""",N:N,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled again.",N:N,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve o""clock the young man met the princes going to the bath and gave her the kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears that he would let her take leave of her father.",Sa:Sa,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"At first he refused, but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last he consented; but the moment she came to her father""s house the guards awoke and he was taken prisoner again.",Su-:Sa,-:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ""You shall never have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops the view from my window.""",N:N,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Now this hill was so big that the whole world could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had done very little, the fox came and said.",N:Sa,N:F
the_golden_bird.emmood,"""Lie down and go to sleep; I will work for you.""",N:N,N:H
the_golden_bird.emmood,"And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone; so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was removed he must give him the princess.",Su+:H,H:H
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ""We will have all three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.""",N:H,H:H
the_golden_bird.emmood,"""Ah!"" said the young man, ""that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?""",H:H,H:H
the_golden_bird.emmood,"""If you will only listen,"" said the fox, ""it can be done.",N:A,N:H
the_golden_bird.emmood,"When you come to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, ""Here she is!""",N:N,N:H
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last.",N:N,N:H
the_golden_bird.emmood,"Then lift her quickly on to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as fast as you can.""",N:N,N:H

cat-skin.emmood,"When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.",N:Su+,H:+
cat-skin.emmood,"Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth.",N:Su+,H:+
cat-skin.emmood,"But the king said, ""You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other.""",H:H,H:H

ashputtel.emmood,"Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her.",Sa:Sa,S:S
ashputtel.emmood,"And the snow fell and spread a beautiful white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife.",N:N,N:S

ashputtel.emmood,"Besides that, the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her.",N:Sa,N:S
ashputtel.emmood,"In the evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.",N:N,N:S
ashputtel.emmood,"It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his wife""s daughters what he should bring them.",N:N,N:N

ashputtel.emmood,"""The first twig, dear father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come homewards,"" said she.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"Then she took it, and went to her mother""s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree.",Sa:Sa,S:S
ashputtel.emmood,"Three times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over her, and brought her whatever she wished for.",Sa:H,S:H
ashputtel.emmood,"Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose a bride for himself.",N:N,N:N

ashputtel.emmood,"Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:",F:N,F:N

ashputtel.emmood,"Long before the end of the hour the work was quite done, and all flew out again at the windows.",N:N,H:N

ashputtel.emmood,"But the mother said, ""No, no! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.""",A:A,A:A

ashputtel.emmood,And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her.,H:N,N:A
ashputtel.emmood,So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.,N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house, and cried out as before:",F:N,N:N

ashputtel.emmood,"But her mother said, ""It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame"": and off she went with her two daughters to the ball.",D:D,D:D
ashputtel.emmood,"Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:",Sa:Sa,S:S
ashputtel.emmood,"""Shake, shake, hazel-tree, Gold and silver over me!""",N:N,S:N
ashputtel.emmood,"Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them on, and followed her sisters to the feast.",N:N,H:N
ashputtel.emmood,"But they did not know her, and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel, taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.",N:N,H:H
ashputtel.emmood,"The king""s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone else came to ask her to dance, he said, ""This lady is dancing with me.""",N:N,H:H
ashputtel.emmood,"Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to go home: and the king""s son said, ""I shall go and take care of you to your home""; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived.",H:N,H:H
ashputtel.emmood,"But she slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as the prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut the door.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the pigeon-house.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"But when they had broken open the door they found no one within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little lamp was burning in the chimney.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"For she had run as quickly as she could through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her little grey frock.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"""Shake, shake, hazel-tree, Gold and silver over me!""",N:N,H:N
ashputtel.emmood,And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she had worn the day before.,N:N,H:H
ashputtel.emmood,"And when she came in it to the ball, everyone wondered at her beauty: but the king""s son, who was waiting for her, took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to dance, he said as before, ""This lady is dancing with me.""",N:N,H:H
ashputtel.emmood,"When night came she wanted to go home; and the king""s son followed here as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang away from him all at once into the garden behind her father""s house.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without being seen.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"Then the king""s son lost sight of her, and could not find out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said to him, ""The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.""",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"The father thought to himself, ""Can it be Ashputtel?""",Su+:Su+,+:N
ashputtel.emmood,"So he had an axe brought; and they cut down the tree, but found no one upon it.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"And when they came back into the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey frock.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she went again into the garden, and said:",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"""Shake, shake, hazel-tree, Gold and silver over me!""",N:N,H:N
ashputtel.emmood,"Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the king""s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to dance, he said, ""This lady is /my/ partner, sir.""",N:N,H:H
ashputtel.emmood,"When night came she wanted to go home; and the king""s son would go with her, and said to himself, ""I will not lose her this time""; but, however, she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs.",F:N,F:H
ashputtel.emmood,"The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father, and said, ""I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper fits.""",N:N,N:N

ashputtel.emmood,"The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"But her great toe could not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her.",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"Then the mother gave her a knife, and said, ""Never mind, cut it off; when you are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.""",N:A,F:A
ashputtel.emmood,"So the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe, and went to the king""s son.",N:D,F:D

ashputtel.emmood,But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:,N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"""Back again! back again! look to the shoe!",N:N,N:N

ashputtel.emmood,"Prince! prince! look again for thy bride, For she""s not the true one that sits by thy side.""",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him.",Su-:Su-,-:-
ashputtel.emmood,"So he turned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home, and said, ""This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put on the slipper.""",N:D,N:D
ashputtel.emmood,"Then she went into the room and got her foot into the shoe, all but the heel, which was too large.",N:N,F:N
ashputtel.emmood,"But her mother squeezed it in till the blood came, and took her to the king""s son: and he set her as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.",N:D,F:D
ashputtel.emmood,"But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still, and sang:",N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"""Back again! back again! look to the shoe!",N:N,N:N

ashputtel.emmood,"Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the shoe, that her white stockings were quite red.",N:Su-,-:-
ashputtel.emmood,So he turned his horse and brought her also back again.,N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"""This is not the true bride,"" said he to the father; ""have you no other daughters?""",N:D,N:D
ashputtel.emmood,"""No,"" said he; ""there is only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am sure she cannot be the bride.""",D:D,D:D
ashputtel.emmood,The prince told him to send her.,N:N,N:N
ashputtel.emmood,"But the mother said, ""No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show herself.""",N:D,-:D
ashputtel.emmood,"However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached her the golden slipper.",N:N,H:N
ashputtel.emmood,"Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot, and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made for her.",N:N,H:H
ashputtel.emmood,"And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said, ""This is the right bride.""",H:H,H:H
ashputtel.emmood,"But the mother and both the sisters were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his horse, and rode away with her.",A:A,A:H
ashputtel.emmood,"And when they came to the hazel-tree, the white dove sang:",N:N,H:H
ashputtel.emmood,"""Home! home! look at the shoe!",N:N,H:H

ashputtel.emmood,"And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon her right shoulder, and so went home with her.",N:N,H:H
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"One summer""s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might.",H:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"Then came a peasant woman down the street crying: ""Good jams, cheap!",N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"Good jams, cheap!""",N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"This rang pleasantly in the tailor""s ears; he stretched his delicate head out of the window, and called: ""Come up here, dear woman; here you will get rid of your goods.""",H:H,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"The woman came up the three steps to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots for him.",N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and at length said: ""The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no consequence.""",H:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling.",A:A,H:A
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"""Now, this jam shall be blessed by God,"" cried the little tailor, ""and give me health and strength""; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it.",H:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"""This won""t taste bitter,"" said he, ""but I will just finish the jacket before I take a bite.""",N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches.",H:H,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts.",H:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"""Hi! who invited you?"" said the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away.",H:N,H:A
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"The flies, however, who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back again in ever-increasing companies.",N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"The little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, and saying: ""Wait, and I will give it to you,"" struck it mercilessly on them.",A:A,H:A

the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,In front of the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket.,N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,It had to go into his pocket with the cheese.,N:N,H:N

the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"The giant read: ""Seven at one stroke,"" and thought that they had been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect for the tiny fellow.",Su+:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it.",N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"""Do that likewise,"" said the giant, ""if you have strength.""",N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"""Is that all?"" said the tailor, ""that is child""s play with us!"" and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it.",H:Su+,H:+
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"""Faith,"" said he, ""that was a little better, wasn""t it?""",H:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it of the little man.",Su+:Su+,H:+
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it.,N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"""Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise,"" ""Well thrown,"" said the tailor, ""but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all,"" and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air.",H:N,H:H
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"The bird, delighted with its liberty, rose, flew away and did not come back.",H:N,H:H
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"""How does that shot please you, comrade?"" asked the tailor.",N:N,H:H
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"""You can certainly throw,"" said the giant, ""but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.""",N:N,H:+
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"He took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said: ""If you are strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the forest.""",N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"""Readily,"" answered the little man; ""take you the trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs; after all, they are the heaviest.""",N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song: ""Three tailors rode forth from the gate,"" as if carrying the tree were child""s play.",H:H,H:H
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"The giant, after he had dragged the heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ""Hark you, I shall have to let the tree fall!""",Sa:F,H:F

the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it down, gave it into the tailor""s hand, and bade him eat.",N:N,H:N
the_valiant_little_tailor.emmood,"But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.",N:N,H:N

tom_thumb.emmood,"Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried out, ""See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take me down!""",H:H,H:N

tom_thumb.emmood,"The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what to say for wonder.",N:Su-,N:N
tom_thumb.emmood,"At last one took the other aside, and said, ""That little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.""",Su+:H,D:-

tom_thumb.emmood,"""Good night, my masters!"" said he, ""I""m off! mind and look sharp after me the next time.""",H:H,H:H
tom_thumb.emmood,"Then they ran at once to the place, and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain; Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as sulky as could be.",A:A,A:H

tom_thumb.emmood,"As soon as she could pick herself up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the parson, and said, ""Sir, sir, the cow is talking!""",F:Su-,N:F

tom_thumb.emmood,"The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his axe, and gave his wife a scythe.",F:F,N:+
